## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with a less is more approach so that there not bombarded with alot of information so its a single page scroll so that the information can be easily found via the navigation bar. 

### Colour
For the colour scheme i have choosen a dark teal blue as its a bold color but has a softness thats appealling to a any a customers eye and i have choosen to use both white and black as contrasting colors so that it matchs the color through-out the gyms enviroment and is also easily visible to all

### Fonts

I have choosen Bebas Neue as the main font as when looking for the ideal font to use it court my eye and it had kept catching my eye when the font weight was changed so Bebas Neue was choosen as its easily read and but still has a style to it

### Structure

the page is a well organised, clean looking and user friendly single scroll page with a seperated contact us page for a different dimension the page was designed to be less is more so that the customer wont be reading massive groups of text but more visual appealling design that can be navigated by the links on the mavigation bar or though a single scroll

<br>
the page consists of 5 seperate sections
- a landing page
- a facilites page that is shown on seperated cards
- a meet the team section that is shown in boxes
- a classes page which is a timeline based structure
- a contact page with a need to know information such as contact number as well as opening hours and a usable map
